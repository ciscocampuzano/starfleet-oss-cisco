# Command Line Interface (CLI)

This will be covered more in the User and Developer Guides, but is mentioned here that Starfleet worker ships expose a CLI so that they can be invoked locally. This is useful for debugging issues or if you just need to run a given payload in one AWS account.

The CLIs are based on the excellent Python [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) framework.
