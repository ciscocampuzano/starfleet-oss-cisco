# Starfleet

## 🚧🏗️👷⚠️Special Note: This project is under heavy development

## What is it?
This is a whole AWS infrastructure automation tool that is able to run Lambda functions with AWS account specific workloads.
It's primary purpose is to enable cloud and infrastructure security teams the ability to run automation for ensuring infrastructure
state across an entire AWS organization in a manner that cannot adequately be achieved with AWS Organizations.

You can make lambdas to do whatever it is that you want to do with the proper context of the AWS account or region that you want
to operate in.
